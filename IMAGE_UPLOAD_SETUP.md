# Image Upload & Media Management Implementation

## Overview
Complete image upload and media management system has been implemented for the Sahamnesia CMS admin panel.

## Components Implemented

### 1. ImageUpload Component (`src/components/admin/ImageUpload.tsx`)
- Drag & drop file upload functionality
- File validation (type, size)
- URL input option for external images
- Image preview with edit/remove options
- Error handling and success feedback
- Integration with Supabase Storage via adminService

### 2. MediaLibrary Page (`src/pages/admin/MediaLibrary.tsx`)
- Complete media file management interface
- Grid and list view modes
- Search and filter capabilities
- Bulk operations (select all, delete multiple)
- File preview, copy URL, and delete actions
- Integration with ImageUpload for new uploads

### 3. Updated AdminService (`src/services/admin.ts`)
- `uploadMedia()` method for file uploads to Supabase Storage
- `getMediaFiles()` for fetching media library
- `deleteMedia()` for file deletion
- Proper error handling and activity logging

### 4. Supabase Storage Setup (`setup_storage.sql`)
- Storage bucket configuration for media files
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Helper functions for cleanup and stats
- File size and type restrictions

## Integration Points

### Blog Post Form
- Featured image upload using ImageUpload component
- Integrated in `src/pages/admin/BlogPostForm.tsx`
- Replaces manual image upload UI

### Admin App Routing
- MediaLibrary accessible at `/admin/media`
- Integrated in AdminApp.tsx routing system

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Run Supabase Storage Setup
**IMPORTANT:** Execute `fix_media_upload_rls.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to:
- Create the 'media' storage bucket
- Set up proper RLS policies for secure access
- Fix authentication issues with media uploads
- Configure file size and type restrictions

**Note:** Run `fix_media_upload_rls.sql` instead of `setup_storage.sql` as it includes the fixes for RLS policy issues.

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your Supabase configuration is properly set in `.env`:
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Features

### File Upload
- Drag & drop interface
- File type validation (images only by default)
- File size limits (configurable, default 5MB for blog posts, 10MB for media library)
- Automatic filename generation with timestamps
- Integration with Supabase Storage

### Media Management
- Grid/list view toggle
- Search by filename or alt text
- Filter by file type (all, images, other)
- Bulk selection and deletion
- Copy file URLs to clipboard
- File preview functionality

### Security
- Admin-only access via RLS policies
- File type restrictions at storage level
- Size limits enforced
- Activity logging for all operations

## Usage

### In Blog Post Creation
1. Navigate to `/admin/blog/create`
2. Use the Featured Image section
3. Drag & drop image or click to browse
4. Alternatively, use "Use URL instead" for external images

### In Media Library
1. Navigate to `/admin/media`
2. Upload new files using the "Upload Files" button
3. Manage existing files with grid or list view
4. Use search and filters to find specific files
5. Copy URLs or delete files as needed

## Technical Notes

### File Storage Structure
- Files stored in Supabase Storage 'media' bucket
- Unique filenames with timestamp + random string
- Original filenames preserved in database
- Public URLs generated for web access

### Database Integration
- Files tracked in `admin_media` table
- Metadata includes original name, size, MIME type
- Alt text and descriptions supported
- Activity logging for audit trail

## Next Steps
The image upload and media management system is now complete and ready for use. Users can:
1. Upload images when creating blog posts
2. Manage media files through the dedicated Media Library
3. Use either file uploads or URL inputs for flexibility
4. Benefit from secure, admin-only access controls

The system is production-ready after running the Supabase storage setup SQL.
